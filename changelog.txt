Update 0.2 is a small update to spice up the mining subworld a little, and a few other minor tweaks.

You can change whether subworld save by default to experience the new generation.
This will wipe the world upon each joining if set to false.

*= Mining Subworld Tweaks =*

Added:
Mining houses
Life crystals
Pots & rubble generation
Secret painting inside of mining houses
Stalagmites (Stalactite -> ceiling, Stalagmite -> floor)

Geode max count reduced from 30 -> 20
Water now generates in medium sized pockets
Guidebook UI tweaks: Background color changed & close button re-done
Traps now generate with half of the previous chance
Slate generation reduced significantly
Dirt generation reduced slightly
Hell houses are no longer generated twice. Previously, this caused houses to generate inside each other.

Bug Fixes:
Glimmercaps no longer are immune to water, and can no longer spawn in water
Smoothing now only applies to stone, slate, and deepstone

Current Known Bugs:
Smoothing does apply to most structures, since the smoothing pass is done near the end.

3 new hallow islands
